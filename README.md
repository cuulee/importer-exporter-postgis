=========================

The 3D City Database Importer/Exporter is a Java based front-end for the 3D City Database. It allows for high-performance importing and exporting spatial data for a virtual 3D city model.

**NOTE:** This repository is only meant to create bugfixes for the previous version 1.6 of the Importer/Exporter for PostgreSQL/PostGIS (to be used with the previous version 2.1 of the 3D City Database). If you want to follow the latest development of the Importer/Exporter, then use this repository instead: https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter
