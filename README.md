=========================

**Note that this repository is OUTDATED.**

It is only used to create bugfixes for the previous version 1.6 of the Importer/Exporter for PostgreSQL/PostGIS (to be used with the previous version 2.1 of the 3D City Database). If you want to follow the latest development of the Importer/Exporter, then use this repository instead: https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter
